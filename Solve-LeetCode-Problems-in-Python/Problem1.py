# Q1
"""
Given an array of integers arr, a lucky integer is an integer that has a frequency in the array equal to its value.

Return the largest lucky integer in the array. If there is no lucky integer return -1.


Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The only lucky number in the array is 2 because frequency[2] == 2.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,2,3,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 1, 2 and 3 are all lucky numbers, return the largest of them.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [2,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no lucky numbers in the array.

# Solution

def findLucky(arr):
    # Step 1: Frequency count
    freq = {}
    for num in arr:
        if num in freq:
            freq[num] += 1
        else:
            freq[num] = 1

    lucky = -1
    for num in freq:
        if freq[num] == num:
            lucky = max(lucky, num)

    return lucky
